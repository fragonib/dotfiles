# Code Templates
Those files are not shared via JetBrains account, so I have to put it here.

Files can be obtained from:
`~/Library/Preferences/IntelliJIdea{version}/fileTemplates`

There is a script on the `scripts` directory to create the symlink, this should be executed after updating
intellij to any new major version

`dot intellij add_code_templates`
